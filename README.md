**How it Works:**

1. **Language Definitions:**
   - `LANGUAGES` is a dictionary where keys are language names (e.g., "JavaScript", "Python") and values are arrays of language-specific patterns.
   - Each pattern within an array is a regular expression object with:
      - `pattern`: The regular expression to match.
      - `points`: Points awarded for each match. Positive points indicate features of the language, negative points indicate features that suggest it's *not* that language.
      - `nearTop`: (Optional) If `True`, the pattern should be matched near the beginning of the code.

2. **Scoring:**
   - For each language:
      - Iterate through the patterns for that language.
      - Apply each pattern to the code snippet.
      - Accumulate the points for each match.

3. **Language Prediction:**
   - Determine the language with the highest score.
   - If no language has a significantly higher score than others, the prediction may be uncertain.

**Limitations:**

- **Simple Heuristics:** The current implementation relies on simple heuristics (regular expressions) and may not accurately detect complex or ambiguous code.
- **Limited Language Support:** While the code supports a wide range of languages, it may not be comprehensive and may miss some niche languages.
- **False Positives/Negatives:** False positives (incorrectly identifying a language) and false negatives (failing to identify the correct language) are possible due to the nature of heuristics and the complexity of real-world code.

**Potential Improvements:**

- **More Sophisticated Language Models:** Incorporate more advanced language models (e.g., machine learning models trained on large code datasets) for more accurate predictions.
- **Contextual Analysis:** Consider the context of the code (e.g., surrounding files, project structure) to improve accuracy.
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Analyze the code's behavior (e.g., by running it) to extract more meaningful features.
- **Lexical Analysis:** Perform more in-depth lexical analysis (tokenization, parsing) to identify language-specific constructs.

**Usage:**

1. **Prepare the code snippet:** The code snippet should be a string.
2. **Call the detection function:** 
   - Pass the code snippet to the detection function.
   - The function will analyze the code and return the predicted language.

**Note:** This is a simplified example. A production-ready implementation would require significant refinement and testing.
